## Introduction

HandSign uses TensorFlow's Object Detection API to recognize hand signs in images and video streams. This project is suitable for applications involving sign language translation, human-computer interaction, and accessibility tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Object Detection API
- [Optional] GPU support for faster training and inference

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handsign-tf-object-detection.git
    cd handsign-tf-object-detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the TensorFlow Object Detection API by following the [official installation guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/main/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2.md).

## Usage

### Training

1. Prepare your hand sign dataset following the structure mentioned in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. Configure the training parameters in the `config` file.
3. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

### Inference

1. Use the trained model for inference:

    ```bash
    python inference.py --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Model Architecture

Our hand sign recognition model is based on a state-of-the-art architecture designed for object detection. It is optimized for accurate detection and classification of hand signs in various scenarios.

## Dataset

For optimal results, use a well-curated dataset that includes diverse hand sign examples with corresponding annotations.

## Results

Our model achieves impressive accuracy on standard hand sign recognition benchmarks. Explore the `results` folder for detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback to help us improve this project.
